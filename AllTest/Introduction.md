# Prog 270 Bihay

Hi, i'm John Riel Bihay, I'm majoring in Information System, Software Development Track concentration. My first experience in programming is back in the Philippines where i studied the basic of JAVA. Now i also learn how to build program basic with C# and C++, i also learn a lot about data structures from the last quarter. I had some working knowledge with web development and currently studying html5, css3 and javascript with other class.
My hobby is biking, camping and i would also like to do fishing someday, i love nature. I took this class because i became interested with mobile development and i would love to create a mobile app of my own. Hoping to learn DevOps i don't know if BC has related classes for it but i'm looking forward to learn it from other classes i have left in my curriculum.</p>
